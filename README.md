Title: Change Detection Algorithm for Vegetation Mapping Using Multispectral Image Processing

Abstract
Agriculture is an important sector of the world. Agriculture’s contribution to the nation’s prosperity cannot be overlooked, despite the industry’s significant role in the global economy. Agriculture in any geographic area is constantly changing. Changes are detected to build a knowledge base in a bid to ensure that certain agricultural traits are preserved in particular location. The process of identifying differences in two different places is known as change detection. This method is typically used to change the earth’s surface two or more times. Here, the primary source of data is geographic which is taken from Google Earth Engine (GEE) and is typically in digital (e.g., satellite imagery) can be used. The history of change detection begins with the history of remote sensing.
